Do you want to learn the basics of Dutch? Then this is the right lesson for you. In this lesson type, we will focus on general language skills (grammar, speaking, reading, writing, listening, spelling and pronunciation). We look at the basic grammar you need to provide and ask for simple information in your own words. The goal of this lesson is to be able to understand and use Dutch in common everyday situations. For example, when:
- meeting new people and introducing yourself, 
- asking for simple information or help, 
- following simple directions and instructions, and
- filling out forms and providing basic information.

During the trial lesson we discussed my learning plan, and as beginner I enjoyed that I could already practice speaking and understanding Dutch, and got valuable tips. It was very useful and I am looking forward to having more lessons with Kitty._
