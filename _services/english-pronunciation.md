## Testimonial
> _Kitty is an excellent teacher. I specifically want to improve my English pronunciation and she helps me every step along the way, with lots of helpful material and homework specifically tailored to my needs. She also has a ton of knowledge about English, which helps tremendously with understanding the pronunciation concepts and rules. I'm very happy to have her as my teacher._ ~ March 24, 2021
