I come from a tiny town in the Dutch countryside, but have always been intrigued by foreign languages and cultures. I left the Netherlands 5 years ago when I started working remotely for educational publishers. I have lived in Spain and Belgium and recently moved to Switzerland. 

My heart is not just in teaching, but in all aspects of education. Over the last 8 years I have worked as a (private) language teacher, test developer, textbook author and editor, and e-learning author. I have taught beginners to advanced learners, both teenagers and adults. As a teacher, I enjoy combining the knowledge and skills I have acquired to create learning plans and individualized content for students.
